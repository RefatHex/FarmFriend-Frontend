# FarmFriend-Frontend
Think about the most common occupation in Bangladesh. Now think about the most
 underdeveloped and overlooked one. The answer to both of them is Agriculture and
 Farming. Even though there are many initiatives to increase the production from the fields,
 we focus on the magicians behind it who often remain unnoticed, the Farmers. To ensure the
 well-being of farmers and to make sure that they get the proper appraisement they deserve,
 we present, Farm-Friend. 
Farm-Friend is a smart digital platform designed to make farming easier and more efficient
 for Bangladeshi farmers. Our goal is to solve real problems farmers face every day, like
 deciding what crops to grow, dealing with weather surprises, getting the right tool and
 equipment, and most importantly, the right price for their produce.
 Farm-Friend provides crop recommendations based on past data and farming techniques. It
 sends real-time weather alerts to help farmers plan their activities and avoid losses. Farmers
 can also use our platform to rent or share farming tools, saving money and resources.
 The system goes further by suggesting fertilizers based on soil tests, ensuring crops get the
 nutrients they need. It provides up-to-date market prices, while connecting farmers, so they
 can communicate and sell their crops at the best rates. It also connects farmers directly to
 storage owners, making it easier to store and sell their harvest without any middlemen. 
Farm-Friend is more than just a tool—it’s a way to make farming smarter and more
 sustainable. By promoting modern farming methods and reducing waste, it helps improve
 farmers' lives and supports Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) like Zero Hunger and
 Decent Work and Economic Growth. With simple easy-to-use features, Farm-Friend is
 designed to bring astonishing benefits to farmers, helping them grow more, earn more, and
 live a better, prosperous life
